Fast: Very high performance, on par with NodeJS and Go (thanks to Starlette and Pydantic). One of the fastest Python frameworks available.

Fast to code: Increase the speed to develop features by about 200% to 300%. *

Fewer bugs: Reduce about 40% of human (developer) induced errors. *
Intuitive: Great editor support. Completion everywhere. Less time debugging.
Easy: Designed to be easy to use and learn. Less time reading docs.
Short: Minimize code duplication. Multiple features from each parameter declaration. Fewer bugs.
Robust: Get production-ready code. With automatic interactive documentation.
Standards-based: Based on (and fully compatible with) the open standards for APIs: OpenAPI (previously known as Swagger) and JSON Schema.Setting up API's in Python without much boiler plate code using Open API spec.

Flask;Hold;Tools;FALSE;"The problem with this approach is that there is no data validation, meaning, that we can pass any type of data being it string, tuple, numbers, or any character. This can break the program often and you can imagine if an ML model getting wrong data types, the program will crash. You can create a data checker before passing the values further but it would add up additional work.

The error pages in Flask as simple HTML pages that can raise decoder errors when the API is being called in other applications. There are other issues with Flask such as slow nature, no async, and web sockets support that can speed up the processes, and finally no automated docs generation system. You need to manually design the user interface for the usage and examples of the API.

Airflow;Hold;Tools;FALSE;"Airflow is a platform to programmatically author, schedule and monitor workflows.
Use airflow to author workflows as directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) of tasks. The airflow scheduler executes your tasks on an array of workers while following the specified dependencies. Rich command line utilities make performing complex surgeries on DAGs a snap. The rich user interface makes it easy to visualize pipelines running in production, monitor progress, and troubleshoot issues when needed.While this might be a controversial opinion, it is really noticable that Airflow was created before the rise of modern schedulers, such as Kubernetes. This results in complexity maintaining Airflow in production when running Airflow on e.g. Kubernetes. Besides that, the python based execution model leads to conflicts when maintaining a larger number of workflows. One of the current best practices running Airflow in production is to dockerize each individual operator, however at that point you might as well move to a container-native workflow solutions such as Argo Workflows. <p><b>We think you should Hold it because</b></p><p>While this might be a controversial opinion, it is really noticable that Airflow was created before the rise of modern schedulers, such as Kubernetes.

AWS Glue;Hold;Tools;FALSE;"AWS Glue is a cloud service that prepares data for analysis through automated extract, transform, load (ETL) processes. The managed service a simple and cost-effective method for categorizing and managing big data in the enterprise. It provides organizations with a data integration tool that formats information from disparate data sources and organizes it in a central repository, where it can be used to inform business decisions.

Glue uses ETL jobs to extract data from a combination of other Amazon Web Services and incorporates it into data lakes and data warehouses. It uses application programming interfaces (APIs) to transform the extracted data set for integration, and to help users monitor jobs.While in theory Glue sounds like a great solution, after all it removes the need to manage worker nodes and provides a lot of features to simplify ETL processing, it is to good to be true. In reality Glue is inflexible, moves your entire development cycle inside the cloud (with a hefty price tag) and doesn't provide a lot to help maintain pipelines in production. Most Glue projects we have seen that make it to production result in an issue maintaining a stable data platform. While it is nice to get started quickly, it seems to stop there. Most features seem to be aimed at Data Scientist wanting a quick solution for their machine learning projects, and for that case it seems well suited. But do not believe any AWS consultant who tells you this is the solution to your production data pipelines.<p><b>We think you should Hold it because</b></p><p>While in theory Glue sounds like a great solution, after all it removes the need to manage worker nodes and provides a lot of features to simplify ETL processing, it is to good to be true.
