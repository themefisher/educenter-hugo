* **'De dikke Heij'**: Also known as the Econometric bible, always an Econometrician by heart. The foundation of my education.
* **Kahlua Matcha**: Essential part of a variation of my favourite cocktail, the Espresso Martini. Only sold in Japan, brought by a good friend of mine.
* **European Bartender School Certificate**: Proud owner of an EBS certificate which I gained in New York during a one-month school. Although I pursued a different career path, I still love to experiment with various recipes now and then.
* **Mexican Elbow**: Favourite bartender tool, best way to get the maximum amount of juice out of fruits or citruses.
* **Cocktail Shaker**: Hard to make cocktails without a shaker, although Gin and Tonic is technically a cocktail.
* **MATLAB 7**: This book is where this hobby all started, although I do not write MATLAB anymore.
* **Red Envelope**: My heritage prescribes giving red envelopes filled with money during special occasions. All nouns in the previous sentence are elements I find important.
* **FAECTOR Dices**: Represents my love for playing games. Board games or computer games, I am always in. I do easily get addicted though.
* **Anatomical Eye Model**: Reminds me of my partner and her job. The respect I have for what she does daily can’t be described. Always played and continues to play an important role in my life.
* **Rotterdam Starbucks Mug**: Proud citizen of the city located in the center of the world. I am also quite fond of coffee, even Starbucks. Although overpriced, you know what you pay for. This mug was a good-bye gift by my dear colleagues of my first (proper) job.
