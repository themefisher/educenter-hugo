In this article I will walk you through the processing of some Dutch COVID-19 data using [Google Dataflow](https://cloud.google.com/dataflow) and [Apache Beam](https://beam.apache.org/) via Spotify’s [Scio](https://spotify.github.io/scio/) Scala library and a dash of Twitter’s [Algebird](https://github.com/twitter/algebird). (Bake at 200 degrees for 20 minutes)

Why this combo? Because I wanted to learn more about Dataflow, from a quick comparison I much prefer the Scala API over the Java or Python API for Beam and Covid numbers are of course a very current topic and relatable for many people.
