* **Headphones**: I love listening to a wide range of music, especially when working as it helps me concentrate. I listen to everything from 70s and 80s rock to EDM.
* **Little book of facts**: I love learning new things, from the useful new concepts to useless facts and titbits of knowledge in books such as these.
* **Coffee Cups:** Although I'm not a big tea fan, I am a big coffee fan, especially good espressos, and for me it is the start of any good day.
* **London Dubble Decker Bus:** Studying in the UK for 3 years was one of the best experiences of my life and has left me with a lot of habits, although I'm still not a big tea fan.
* **Puzzle**: I love challenging myself with a new puzzle, both physical and mental puzzles. During Corona-time when working from home, fiddling with such puzzles also helps me concentrate during meetings.
