Talk 1: Towards More Energy-Efficient Neural Networks? Use Your Brain  
  
In the last decade many different types of neural networks have been developed. They showed us the amazing power and opportunities of machine learning. On the other hand the whole training process is not that efficient and costs a lot of energy. With that in mind we do know that neural networks are sort of based on the way humans learn. Except that the human brain is much more energy efficient. Could we achieve that same energy-efficient level in artificial neural networks? The answer is yes! I will show you what is often called the third generation neural networks: Spiking Neural Networks.  
Let’s go for great accuracy and major energy savings!

Talk 2: Content Recommendations in Hyperlocal Communities  
  
Jodel is a hyperlocal community app operating around the entire world  
that allows users to share text, images, and videos with other users in  
their area in real-time. Among other things like content moderation and  
image detection, one goal of our Data Science team is to find the best  
content for every user. We are currently moving away from a strictly  
(reverse) chronological feed towards a more personalized feed. One core  
challenge is to infer content preferences from hundreds of millions of  
user interactions every day. In this talk, I will give an overview on  
different content recommendation approaches that we have been testing  
lately at Jodel, how we cope with the challenge rising from the  
hyperlocal setting, how we develop different approaches offline, and  
then eventually test them in experiments in our app.
