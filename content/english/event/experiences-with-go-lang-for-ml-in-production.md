Making the leap from experimental ML projects to operational, production-ready remains an industry-wide challenge.

The hand-off between data scientists and engineers tends to result in friction as these worlds tend to operate in different paradigms.

We have recently encountered this scenario at Port of Rotterdam, which led us to experiment with replacing various Python-based components with Go.

We will explore the ML ecosystem and lifecycle, where Go is a viable and mature replacement and what benefits this change offers.

Speakers: Thijs Koot and Tim de Klijn

This is an online event.

Time: 18:30 - 19:30
