Becoming a data driven organization, supporting data science initiatives, or running an array of data driven applications need a coherent data platform approach to be successful. If ignored or done wrongly, data driven programs fail, falter or lag unnecessarily in the transition from working data science code to a production system that delivers reliable business value. Slow development speed, bad data quality, high maintenance toil, compliance-as-afterthought, security vulnerabilities, scaling pains and service downtime; preventable problems that can turn a good idea into an expensive failure.

We have compressed years of experience in successfully designing, building and operating large data intensive systems at a large variety of organizations into a structured approach to data architecture.

This structured approach to data architecture puts the delivery of business value first and allows you to make clear choices in design trade-offs before they become a problem.

Our course "Introduction to Data Architecture" teaches you that structured approach. You will learn:

* **The** **basic building blocks** of data architectures
* **Common data architecture patterns** and their trade-offs
* The **7 core principles of Data Architecture** and how to apply them
* How to **guard value and increase iteration speed** using the process and deliverables of the Data Architecture Journey
* **How to** **formulate a high-level implementation** plan based on business needs


* **How to identify and analyze the gap** between the business needs and the existing data landscape
* **To apply this approach in workshops** based on real-world cases
